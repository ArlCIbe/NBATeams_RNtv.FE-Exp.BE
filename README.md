# Week26_Day02_CodeChallenge - React Native App with a Backend Server

## Code Challenge

For this first exercise, you'll use the server you created in the Module 3 Week 12 Day 3 as your backend.

- Create a repo on your GitHub. You'll turn in the link to this repo for the assignment when you're done.

- Copy your Express Server from Week 12 Day 3 into your repo folder. Then Create a new React Native app using the default project template in your repo.

- Customize the Header image and Tab Icons for the Home Page.

- Change the Explore page to have a new Ionicon, custom header image, and the content of the page should render the data from your Express app. Be creative with how you present each team. Bonus points for incorporating each team's logo when rendered on the page.

- Don't forget to ACP ( Add your changes, Commit your changes, Push your changes ) to github and submit your repo link to this assignment!
